#New Goals for Sep 10: 
- Evaluate accuracy w & w/o subsampling in front view with SqueezeNet, Unet, and ChipNet
- Evaluate better data-augmentation (noise, peturbations, adding closings, or hole closings with morphological filtering)
- Upload a few video outputs to demonstrate the output
- Use Carla pointclouds generated using 64 layers, 32 layers, 16 layers, 8 layers(these are directly configurable in CARLA and would not require subsampling, though will be costly to store). The ground truth can be generated by mapping points into semantic segmentation ground truth provided by Carla.
- Integrate semantic kitti database


# Article corrections
- Better explain the motivation and the contribution
- Better explain and show the advantages in using geometrical features
- Move to front view representation and show how subsampling could benefit computationally the prediction.
- Add a discussion of the results obtained
- [optional] Compare results obtained with bev-view and front-view


# Future goals
- Create an annotated dataset using the method from Kitti-Road segmentation to generate datasets on NuSceneces and possibly other datasets(Waymo) : Create a RoadNet dataset ? This could be a CVPR submission if we work hard :)
