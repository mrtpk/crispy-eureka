Evaluating the effect of spatial resolution for road detection using Lidar point clouds

# Goals : 
- Evaluate effect of using sparse point cloud lidars using model trained on dense pointclodus
- Use FCN, U-Net and standard encoder-decoder architectures
- Use XYZI, RGB, Geometrical(Leo) features like Normals, Eigen features as inputs and evaluate which combinations are discriminant for road 
- Also study which features are robust to spatial resolution (subsampling)

# Future goals
- Create an annotated dataset using the method from Kitti-Road segmentation to generate datasets on NuSceneces and possibly other datasets(Waymo) : Create a RoadNet dataset ? This could be a CVPR submission if we work hard :)
