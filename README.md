# crispy-eureka
* Evaluating the effect of spatial resolution for road detection using Lidar point clouds, camera and geometrical features
* Currently submitted to [CVRSUAD ICCVW 2019](https://sites.google.com/view/cvrsuad/), decision : Notification of Acceptance: August 23th, 2019.
* New Deadline : AUTONOMOUS DRIVING ICCV'19 [Workshop](https://adworkshop.org/call-for-papers/),  Aug. 20, 2019, decision Aug 30 2019

#New Goals for Aug 20: 
- Evaluate accuracy w & w/o subsampling in front view with SqueezeNet, Unet, and ChipNet
- Evaluate better data-augmentation (noise, peturbations, adding closings, or hole closings with morphological filtering)
- Upload a few video outputs to demonstrate the output
- Use Carla pointclouds generated using 64 layers, 32 layers, 16 layers, 8 layers(these are directly configurable in CARLA and would not require subsampling, though will be costly to store). The ground truth can be generated by mapping points into semantic segmentation ground truth provided by Carla.

# Future goals
- Create an annotated dataset using the method from Kitti-Road segmentation to generate datasets on NuSceneces and possibly other datasets(Waymo) : Create a RoadNet dataset ? This could be a CVPR submission if we work hard :)
