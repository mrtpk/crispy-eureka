# New Goals for Sep 10: 
- Evaluate accuracy w & w/o subsampling in front view with SqueezeNet, Unet, and ChipNet
- Evaluate better data-augmentation (noise, peturbations, adding closings, or hole closings with morphological filtering)
- Upload a few video outputs to demonstrate the output
- Use Carla pointclouds generated using 64 layers, 32 layers, 16 layers, 8 layers(these are directly configurable in CARLA and would not require subsampling, though will be costly to store). The ground truth can be generated by mapping points into semantic segmentation ground truth provided by Carla.
- Integrate semantic kitti database


# Article corrections
- Better explain the motivation and the contribution : Feature extraction to learn robust representations for sparse pointclouds to perform road segmentation
- Better explain and show the advantages in using geometrical features : How does normal estimation help in localizing the road (Curbs, edges of the road)
- Move to front view representation and show how subsampling could benefit computationally the prediction. (Front view ground truth should be measured in the highest resolution possible)
- Compare results obtained with bev-view and front-view

# Contributions : 
- Geometrical features improve and dont degrage performance for road seg with subsampling
- Spectral features dont degrade performance for road seg with subsampling
- Evaluating the effect of density variation in classification of road segmentation
- First benchmark on Semantic KITTI for road segmentation

# Future goals (ICRA Deadline)
- Evaluate geometrical features (normal) performance (Leo)
- Move to Semantic KITTI and evaluate performance on the road class (Leo/Ravi)
- Work on Front view and evaluate performance with subsampling, models : u-net, squeezenet, lodnn (Leo/Ravi)
- Evaluate the performance of spectral features from Pyntcloud w and w/o subsampling (Thomas)
- Correct/Fix the HOG computation (Ravi)
- Handle Class imbalance (very few points corresponding to road)

# Secondary goals if we have time
- Improve 2d-grid feature extraction in BEV using kernel density estimate
