The VLP16 dataset is created using Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR. The ground truth is annotated in bird's eye view of the point cloud. 821 samples are divided into 632 train and 189 test samples. 

LoDNN model was trained on this dataset and inference is done on test dataset. The results are in this video file (`LoDNN_VLP16_output.mp4`)[https://drive.google.com/open?id=125UrtZxUD36Qwn7S1z3ywuGjens_bymc].
